    <string name="objective_instruction">You are at War!! Your Mission is to eliminate as many enemy Submarines as you can, and Survive the under water Anarchy.\n\nYour Submarine can withstand only a limited damage, but your Sonar Battery gets Recharged and Missiles get Reloaded with time.\n\nThe Sonar could be activated by hitting the Radar Button, which deactivates Missiles and activates the Sonar Gun. Hitting the Radar again would deactivate the Sonar Gun and Activate the Missile again.</string>
    <string name="sonar_instruction">The Sonar Mode can be used to identify the location of the enemy Submarine in the depths of the ocean. In Sonar Mode, you can activate two types of Sonar beams, ACTIVE PING and VISUAL BUBBLE.\n\nActive Ping could be used by touching the part of the screen that you need visualize and the Enemy cannot see you accurately in this mode.\n\nVisual Bubble could be selected by touching your Submarine, which would highlight the area around you. But Caution!! The enemy could accurately locate you, and could fire at you with double precision. Visual Bubble also eats up more Sonar Battery than Active Ping. So choose the Sonar Wisely.\n\nThe Extent of Damage, Battery level of Sonar Machine and the number of Missiles available is shown in the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe game uses Axis Control to navigate the Submarine. Hold the device in a balanced position to control the Submarine.\n\nThe higher the difficulty level, the more you Score.</string>
